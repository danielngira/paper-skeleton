Tanzania suffered a major internet outage on October 29th, the day of its national elections in 2025. While Tanzanian authorities have yet to admit to an intentional shutdown, the incumbent government’s re-election during the shutdown ignited political tension across the country and has led many Tanzanian citizens to believe that the internet outage was a deliberate move by the government to stifle political discourse. We seek to answer whether potential alternative hypotheses, such as a deep-sea cable outage like the one that occurred in Kenya during a similar period of political unrest in 2024, could explain the brief internet shutdown in Tanzania. We will be borrowing from the methodology of Georgia Tech’s IODA project report on the 2024 outage in Kenya and performing a deep dive into more granular historical data using the OONI MAT. We hypothesize that non-localized alternative hypotheses such as deep-sea cable outages are likely untrue, as the outage was observed exclusively within Tanzania.
