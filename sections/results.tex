\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Our first step in performing this analysis was to determine the exact time that the outage occurred. We analyzed data from Georgia Tech’s IODA database and found that the outage occurred from around noon on October 29th (election day) to noon on November 1st. There was a brief 2-hour return of internet connectivity around noon on October 30th (a day after the elections), but the outage soon returned.

Figure~\ref{fig:ioda-timeseries}, connectivity drops sharply just
after polls open.
